{@kelpResearcher}   Hi there folks! Welcome to the Kelpdom!
                    At least that's what I call the Great Channel Kelp Research Station.
                    You're... {player-name}, right? I'm Jules.
{@player}   Hi Jules! We're here to help with {slow}the Kelpdom?{/slow}
            Where should we report for our first task? 
{@kelpResearcher}   Oh, super! We can always use the help!
                    Check the {h}Job Board{/h} on your dash.
                    You'll find everything you need to get started there.

{@kevin} Modeling is pretty straightforward. You don't even need Calculus!
	Just use your bestiary to add some rules, and they will influence the graph.
	Play around until things start to look right.
