{@player}   So, what should we be doing right now?
{@kevin}    Well, I'd think we need to find some work!

            Maybe we should check out the job board?

            Is there anywhere on this ship where we can see available jobs?
    $if scene:name == "Ship", session:nav.shipRoom == "helm"
            {@player}   Oh, yeah, right in front of us there's the job board.
                        Should be synced up with the current station.
    $else
            {@player}   Oh yeah, we have a job board in the helm.
                        Should be synced up with the current station.
    $endif // scene:name == "Ship", session:nav.shipRoom == "helm"
    {@kevin}   Great! Then we should check there.

{@player}   Any idea what we should be doing right now?
{@kevin}    Maybe we should head back to the helm and take a job?

{@player}   I'm stuck. Anything I'm missing?
{@kevin}    It looks like there are some jobs you already started.
            Why not pick those back up?

{@player}   Kevin, any help?
{@kevin}    I'd recommend we see if there are any jobs available for us.

{@player}   Kevin, any words of wisdom? I'm a bit stuck.
{@kevin}    I wonder if there are any jobs available for us to take...

{@player}       Uh, Kevin? Any idea what I should be doing?
{@kevin #confused}
        Oh, well, uh... I don't have anything specific.
        {#} But I'd look back at what the job-giver had to tell us.
        And maybe check your bestiary too?
